These are GGJ entries where I was doing a majority of the coding, instead of making art assets.

## Circle Ray GGJ '16

My sole entry for 2016. It's a game about reflecting a laser off the interior of a circle. The tricky part was translating the geometrical math to code.

## Dino Egg - GGJ '17

I was the main coder for this project. In this game, you play as a dinosaur trying to balance eggs while racing to the finish-line.

These are GGJ entries where I was doing a majority of the coding, instead of making art assets.

## Circle Ray - GGJ '16

My solo entry for 2016. It's a game about reflecting a laser off the interior of a circle. The tricky part was translating the geometrical math to code.

## Dino Egg - GGJ '17

I was the main coder for this project. In this game, you play as a dinosaur trying to balance eggs while racing to the finish-line.

The ground is procedurally generated using an array of randomly-positioned points. A mesh is generated by drawing triangles and assigning UVs between them, like so:

While I wasn't a coder for this one, I did compose the soundtrack. Listen to it [here](https://soundcloud.com/squider-1/sets/ggj-2018-break-force-soundtrack).
